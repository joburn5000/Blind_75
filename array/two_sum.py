"""
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

# Brute Force Method:

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):

                    return [i,j]

"""
Explanation:

We check all possible pairs and return the ones such that the values sum to the target.

# Hash Map Method:

class Solution2:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, value in enumerate(nums):
            remaining = target - nums[i]
            if remaining in seen:
                return [i, seen[remaining]]
            seen[value] = i
       
"""
Explanation:

We use a hash map to optimize the problem. If the remaining amount has been seen
already, then we return the index i and where the index of the remaining value.
